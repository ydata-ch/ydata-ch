        <p class="mb-4"><strong>Benefit: Ensure data accuracy and operational consistency from day one.</strong> By using a pre-vetted, managed library of hardware models, you eliminate the guesswork and errors of manual device type creation.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>✅ <strong>Managed &amp; Maintained Library:</strong> We provide a rich catalog of common enterprise and datacenter hardware, complete with accurate component layouts, part numbers, and high-resolution elevation images.</li>
          <li>✅ <strong>Lifecycle Intelligence Included:</strong> Every device type includes critical End-of-Life, End-of-Support, and End-of-Sale dates, turning your Netbox instance into a proactive tool for lifecycle management and budget planning.</li>
          <li>✅ <strong>One-Click Push to Netbox:</strong> Select any device type from the catalog and push it directly into your Netbox instance. Our service handles the creation of the manufacturer, device type, all component templates, and even uploads the images for you.</li>
          <li>✅ <strong>Eliminate Configuration Drift:</strong> Stop dealing with inconsistent, user-created device types. Enforce standardization across your entire infrastructure, ensuring that datasheets and reports are always accurate.</li>
