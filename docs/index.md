Welcome to the official documentation for the ydata Portal. This guide provides everything you need to know to leverage the portal's powerful features and enhance your interaction with your Netbox Source of Truth.

### What is the ydata Portal?

The ydata Portal is a high-performance web application that connects to your existing Netbox instance via its API. It's not a replacement for Netbox but an intelligent business and operations layer built on top of it, designed to transform raw data into actionable insights.

*   **For Engineers:** Drastically reduce troubleshooting time with automated, end-to-end signal tracing and comprehensive datasheets for both devices and providers.
*   **For Finance & Asset Managers:** Bridge the gap between technical assets and financial data with powerful depreciation and lifecycle reporting tools.
*   **For IT Management:** Gain high-level oversight with automated monthly reports, KPI dashboards, and proactive EOL/EOS forecasting.
