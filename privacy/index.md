        <h2 id="legal-bases">3. WHAT LEGAL BASES DO WE RELY ON TO PROCESS YOUR INFORMATION?</h2>

        <p><em><strong>In Short:</strong> We only process your personal information when we believe it is necessary and we have a valid legal reason (i.e., legal basis) to do so under applicable law, like with your consent, to comply with laws, to provide you with services to enter into or fulfill our contractual obligations, to protect your rights, or to fulfill our legitimate business interests.</em></p>

        <p>The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and UK GDPR require us to explain the valid legal bases we rely on in order to process your personal information. As such, we may rely on the following legal bases to process your personal information:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Consent.</strong> We may process your information if you have given us permission (i.e., consent) to use your personal information for a specific purpose. You can withdraw your consent at any time.</li>
            <li><strong>Performance of a Contract.</strong> We may process your personal information when we believe it is necessary to fulfill our contractual obligations to you, including providing our Services or at your request prior to entering into a contract with you.</li>
            <li><strong>Legitimate Interests.</strong> We may process your information when we believe it is reasonably necessary to achieve our legitimate business interests and those interests do not outweigh your interests and fundamental rights and freedoms. For example, we may process your personal information for some of the purposes described in order to:
                <ul>
                    <li>Analyze how our Services are used so we can improve them to engage and retain users</li>

            </li>
            <li><strong>Legal Obligations.</strong> We may process your information where we believe it is necessary for compliance with our legal obligations, such as to cooperate with a law enforcement body or regulatory agency, exercise or defend our legal rights, or disclose your information as evidence in litigation in which we are involved.</li>
            <li><strong>Vital Interests.</strong> We may process your information where we believe it is necessary to protect your vital interests or the vital interests of a third party, such as situations involving potential threats to the safety of any person.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="when-we-share">4. WHEN AND WITH WHOM DO WE SHARE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?</h2>

        <p><em><strong>In Short:</strong> We may share information in specific situations described in this section and/or with the following third parties.</em></p>

        <p><strong>Vendors, Consultants, and Other Third-Party Service Providers.</strong> We may share your data with third-party vendors, service providers, contractors, or agents ("<strong>third parties</strong>") who perform services for us or on our behalf and require access to such information to do that work. We have contracts in place with our third parties, which are designed to help safeguard your personal information. This means that they cannot do anything with your personal information unless we have instructed them to do it. They will also not share your personal information with any organization apart from us. They also commit to protect the data they hold on our behalf and to retain it for the period we instruct.</p>

        <p>The third parties we may share personal information with are as follows:</p>

            <li><strong>Authentication Services</strong><br><code>zitadel.cloud</code></li>

        </ul>

        <h2 id="cookies">5. DO WE USE COOKIES AND OTHER TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES?</h2>
        
        <p><em><strong>In Short:</strong> We may use cookies and other tracking technologies to collect and store your information.</em></p>
        
        <p>We may use cookies and similar tracking technologies (like web beacons and pixels) to gather information when you interact with our Services. Some online tracking technologies help us maintain the security of our Services, prevent crashes, fix bugs, save your preferences, and assist with basic site functions, such as authentication and remembering your settings.</p>

        <h2 id="how-long-we-keep">6. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?</h2>

        <p><em><strong>In Short:</strong> We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Notice unless otherwise required by law.</em></p>

        <p>We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this Privacy Notice, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting, or other legal requirements). No purpose in this notice will require us keeping your personal information for longer than the period of time in which users have an account with us.</p>
        
        <p>When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.</p>
        
        <h2 id="how-we-keep-safe">7. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?</h2>

        <p><em><strong>In Short:</strong> We aim to protect your personal information through a system of organizational and technical security measures.</em></p>
        
        <p>We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and organizational security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to and from our Services is at your own risk. You should only access the Services within a secure environment.</p>

By using the Services, you represent that you are at least 18 or that you are the parent or guardian of such a minor and consent to such minor dependent’s use of the Services. If we learn that personal information from users less than 18 years of age has been collected, we will deactivate the account and take reasonable measures to promptly delete such data from our records. If you become aware of any data we may have collected from children under age 18, please contact us at <a href="mailto:info@ydc.ch">info@ydc.ch</a>.</p>

        <p>Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage, no uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this Privacy Notice.</p>
